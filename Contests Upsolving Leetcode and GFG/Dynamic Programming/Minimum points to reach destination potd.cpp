/*
Given a m*n grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative, or zero point. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points. Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points, the task is to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0) by following these certain set of rules :
1. From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1).
2. We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) are <= 0.
3. We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.

Example 1:

Input:
m = 3, n = 3
points = {{-2,-3,3},
          {-5,-10,1},
          {10,30,-5}}
Output:
7
Explanation: 7 is the minimum value to reach the destination with positive throughout the path. Below is the path. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) We start from (0, 0) with 7, we reach (0, 1) with 5, (0, 2) with 2, (1, 2) with 5, (2, 2) with and finally we have 1 point (we needed greater than 0 points at the end).

Example 2:

Input:
m = 3, n = 2
points = {{2,3},
          {5,10},
          {10,30}}
Output:
1
Explanation: Take any path, all of them are positive. So, required one point at the start

};

/* Explanation:
- The `minPoints` function initializes the memoization table `dp` and calls the `solve` function to find the minimum initial points needed.
- The `solve` function recursively calculates the minimum points needed to reach the destination while following the given rules.
- It starts from the cell (0, 0) and recursively explores the possible paths moving right and down until it reaches the destination cell (m-1, n-1).
- At each cell, it calculates the minimum points needed based on the points accumulated so far and updates the memoization table.
- The base case is when it reaches the destination cell, where it returns the minimum positive points needed.
- It memoizes the intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the memoization table. */
