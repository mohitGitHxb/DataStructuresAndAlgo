/* 
@ The problem statement describes a scenario where Geek is shopping at a grocery store and needs to buy `n` items. The price of each item is represented by an array `p`, where `p[i]` is the price of the `i-th` item. The store also offers a bonus on all items, where if Geek buys the `i-th` item, he can get `f[i]` items for free. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of money Geek will need to buy `n` items.

&   The provided solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem. The function `minCost` takes as input the number of items to buy `n`, a vector of integers representing the price of each item `p`, and a vector of integers representing the number of free items for each item `f`. It creates an unordered map to store the intermediate results and calls the helper function `solve` with the initial values.

&   The helper function `solve` takes as input the vectors representing the price and free items for each item, the number of items left to buy, the current index in the vectors, and a reference to the unordered map used for memoization. It first checks if there are no more items left to buy, in which case it returns 0. If the current index is less than 0, it returns a large value to represent an invalid state.

&   The function then checks if the current state has already been calculated and stored in the unordered map. If it has, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it calculates two values: `buy` and `notbuy`, which represent the minimum cost if Geek buys or does not buy the current item, respectively.

&   If Geek does not buy the current item, `notbuy` is equal to the result of calling `solve` with the same number of items left to buy and the previous index. If Geek buys the current item, `buy` is equal to the price of the current item plus the result of calling `solve` with one less item left to buy (since he bought one) and minus the number of free items he gets for buying the current item.

&   The function then stores and returns the minimum of these two values in the unordered map.

*   The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where n is the number of items to buy and m is the number of different items available, since it needs to calculate all possible combinations of items left to buy and indices in the vectors. The space complexity is also O(n * m), since it uses an unordered map to store up to n * m intermediate results.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:
&-  The function `minCost` takes as input the number of items to buy `n`, a vector of integers representing the price of each item `p`, and a vector of integers representing the number of free items for each item `f`.
&-  It creates an unordered map to store intermediate results.
&-  It calls the helper function `solve` with initial values.
&-  The helper function `solve` takes as input vectors representing price and free items for each item, number of items left to buy, current index in vectors, and reference to unordered map used for memoization.
&-  It checks if there are no more items left to buy or if current index is less than 0.
&-  It checks if current state has already been calculated and stored in unordered map.
&-  If not, it calculates two values: `buy` and `notbuy`, which represent minimum cost if Geek buys or does not buy current item.
&-  If Geek does not buy current item, `notbuy` equals result of calling `solve` with same number of items left to buy and previous index.
&-  If Geek buys current item, `buy` equals price of current item plus result of calling `solve` with one less item left to buy (since he bought one) minus number of free items he gets for buying current item.
&-  Function stores and returns minimum of these two values in unordered map.
