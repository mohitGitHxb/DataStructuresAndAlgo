/*
There is a large (m - 1) x (n - 1) rectangular field with corners at (1, 1) and (m, n) containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays hFences and vFences respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates (hFences[i], 1) to (hFences[i], n) and vertical fences are from the coordinates (1, vFences[i]) to (m, vFences[i]).

Return the maximum area of a square field that can be formed by removing some fences (possibly none) or -1 if it is impossible to make a square field.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note: The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (1, n) and (m, 1) to (m, n) and two vertical fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (m, 1) and (1, n) to (m, n). These fences cannot be removed.



Example 1:

Input: m = 4, n = 3, hFences = [2,3], vFences = [2]
Output: 4
Explanation: Removing the horizontal fence at 2 and the vertical fence at 2 will give a square field of area 4.

Example 2:

Input: m = 6, n = 7, hFences = [2], vFences = [4]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proved that there is no way to create a square field by removing fences.

    /*
    The intuition behind this code is to find the maximum square area that can be formed within a field with fences. The fences are represented by two vectors, one for horizontal fences and one for vertical fences. The code first adds the boundaries of the field to the fences, then sorts the fences for easier calculation. It then calculates the unique distances between horizontal fences and stores them in a set. After that, it checks if the distances between vertical fences exist in the set of horizontal distances. If it does, it calculates the area of the square and updates the maximum area. Finally, if no square can be formed, it returns -1, otherwise it returns the square of the maximum area.
