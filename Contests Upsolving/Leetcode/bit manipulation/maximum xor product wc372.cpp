/* Intuition:

The goal is to find the maximum value of the expression (a XOR x) * (b XOR x) for all possible values of x in the range [0, 2^n). To maximize this expression, we need to choose the bits of x carefully. The code uses a bitwise approach to iteratively set bits in a and b to maximize their XOR.
Hints:

    The key observation is that setting a bit in a and b at the same position increases their XOR value.
    Start with the most significant bit (MSB) and iterate towards the least significant bit (LSB).
    If the corresponding bits in a and b are the same, set that bit in both a and b.
    If the bits are different, set the bit in a and clear it in b to maximize the XOR value.

Algorithm:

    Initialize a loop from the MSB to the LSB (from n-1 to 0).
    Inside the loop, calculate the value of the current bit position (val) using 1LL << i.
    Check if the corresponding bits in a and b are the same:
        If yes, set the bit in both a and b.
        If no, set the bit in a and clear it in b.
    After the loop, return the result of the expression (a * b) % mod.

Time Complexity:

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of bits. The loop iterates through each bit, and bitwise operations take constant time.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables, regardless of the input size. */
