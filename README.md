# DataStructuresAndAlgo Repository

Welcome to the **DataStructuresAndAlgo** repository! This comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions aims to provide a solid foundation for your coding and problem-solving skills. This repository focuses on questions from GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode, particularly drawing from the course "Complete Interview Preparation" by GFG.

## Repository Structure

### 1. SHEET Folder

The **SHEET** folder is a treasure trove of DSA questions sourced from prominent DSA sheets such as Striver A2Z and Love Babbar 450. Within this folder, you will find meticulously curated questions accompanied by their most optimized solutions. Each solution is presented with detailed code explanations, allowing you to grasp the underlying concepts and logic. This folder is designed to help you comprehend and implement solutions effectively.

### 2. content-upsolving Folder

The **content-upsolving** folder offers a collection of medium to hard-level questions sourced from GFG weekly, LeetCode weekly, and biweekly contests. These questions have been meticulously chosen to enhance your problem-solving skills. Each question is supplemented with a comprehensive explanation and an optimized code solution. This folder is an excellent resource for practicing a diverse range of challenging problems and refining your problem-solving prowess.

## Language

All the programs and solutions in this repository have been crafted exclusively in C++. The use of C++ allows you to explore DSA concepts in a versatile and efficient programming language, and it aligns with the primary focus of the repository.
